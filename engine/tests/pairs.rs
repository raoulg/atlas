//! Pairs: the same program twice, once as good practice writes it and once with the shortcut
//! people typically take. The clean one must read as the algebra says; the shortcut must show as
//! a shortcut (a place the code does not name, an open question), never as if it were clean and
//! never not at all. What differs between the two pictures is what Atlas lays bare.

/// no path: its requests go to an address the code does not say, and the paths in its table join
/// nothing. So in TypeScript (`clean`, `shortcut`), Python (`pyclean`, `pyshortcut`) and Rust
